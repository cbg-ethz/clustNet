```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(graphClust)
```


### Demonstration:
Simulate binary data and learn clusters subsequently.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Simulate binary data
ss <- c(400,500,600) # samples in each cluster
myData <- sampleData(kclust = 3, Nvars = 20, sseed = 2, samplesizes = ss)

# Graph-based clustering
clusterRes <- graphCluster(myData, kclust = 3)
```
